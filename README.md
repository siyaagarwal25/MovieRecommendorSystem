#  Movie Recommender System

A machine learningâ€“based movie recommender system that suggests movies based on similarity in content and popularity trends. This project helps users discover new movies tailored to their preferences.

##  Overview

With thousands of movies released every year, choosing what to watch next can be overwhelming. This recommender system solves that problem by analyzing metadata (like genres, cast, and keywords) and suggesting movies similar to a given title.

This system supports:
- **Content-based filtering** â€“ recommends similar movies based on metadata
- **Popularity-based filtering** â€“ recommends trending/highly rated movies

The project is built purely in Python and works in a local Jupyter Notebook environment.
